You need to obtain a YouTube Data API key from the Google Cloud Console. You can follow these steps to do this:

Visit the Google Cloud Console website and navigate to a project (or create a new one).
Click on the 'Library' tab in the left menu.
Search for 'YouTube Data API v3' and click on it when you find it.
Click on the 'Enable' button.
Click on the 'Credentials' option in the left menu.
Click on the 'Create Credentials' button and select the 'API key' option.
Copy the generated key and paste it into your code, replacing 'YOUR_API_KEY'.
Similarly, get the part that comes after the 'list=' parameter in the URL of the YouTube playlist. This is the ID of the playlist. Paste this ID into your code, replacing 'YOUR_PLAYLIST_ID'.
Make sure your API key and playlist ID are set correctly. After confirming that these values are correct, you can run your code again.
